"Roll and Win" is a simple and engaging dice game created using JavaScript. The game allows players to roll a virtual dice and win points based on the outcome of the roll. The objective of the game is to accumulate the highest score.

Key Features:

User Interface: The game provides a user-friendly interface with interactive elements, including a dice image, a "Roll" button, and a score display.

Random Dice Rolls: When the player clicks the "Roll" button, the game generates a random number between 1 and 6, simulating the roll of a standard six-sided dice.
